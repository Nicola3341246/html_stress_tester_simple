# HTML Stress Tester ðŸ¦¾

Welcome to the HTML Stress Tester, a program designed to stress the HTML, CSS, JS, and your browser.

### Run it Yourself

We haven't yet deployed this website, which is why you have to run it on your own. Don't worry, it isn't that complicated.

1. First, press the **Code** button on the main page of this repository and then press **Download ZIP**. Now you need to unzip the file. 
Alternatively, if you have the Git CLI installed on your PC, you can run `git clone https://github.com/Nicola3341246/html_stress_tester_simple.git` in your terminal in the target folder.

2. You need to double-click on the **index.html** file you find in the root folder.
